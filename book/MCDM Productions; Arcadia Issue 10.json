						"Playtesting made this issue (and every previous issue of {@i ARCADIA}) awesome. If you like what you read in this magazine, please join me in thanking our invaluable testers and Lars Bakke, the Production and Playtest Director for {@i ARCADIA} and MCDM Productions.",
						"When I first started working with MCDM as a contractor, I was delighted to learn they had a full-time staff member overseeing playtesting. Every tabletop company I've worked with runs playtests a little differently, and none put as much care or as many rounds of testing into the process as MCDM. It's one reason I wanted to join the team full-time!",
						"For {@i ARCADIA}, I go through my own suggested revisions with the authors, and then each article goes through two rounds of development testing. In the first round, a dedicated team of paid playtesters gives initial feedback on the article. I read their comments and summarize them for the author. Then the writer takes that feedback and makes any revisions they deem necessary. (It is their name on the byline, after all, so they get final say!) Round two is similar to round one, except that the article is playtested by a bigger group of volunteer testers (which also includes the contractors from round one).",
						"Since {@i ARCADIA} is a monthly magazine, we're doing this process at least three times a month alongside everything else we test, like content for {@class Illrigger|ILL|The Illrigger} or {@book Kingdoms & Warfare|KaW} (which have much longer development cycles and many rounds of testing, including public playtests). After going through two rounds of playtesting and revision, the articles head off to final edit, where {@link Sadie Lowry|https://twitter.com/incandescaent} and {@link Hannah Rose|https://twitter.com/wildrosemage} perform incredible feats of language arts...and language maths. Once they've done their thing, {@link Jen McCleary|https://www.jenmccleary.com/} takes the words from the development side and the illustrations from our art team and lays it all out into a magazine...that goes back into playtesting.",
						"The MCDM staff and our contract testers go through another few rounds of proofreading the layout to catch typos and other errors, which we report to Jen, who fixes them. Then we send the InDesign files to {@link Chris Hopper|https://twitter.com/chrishopper2}, who makes the articles accessible and tackles any very lastminute fixes we ask.",
						"After all that, you get the magazine, but testing still ain't done! Our senior tester, {@link Spencer Hibnick|https://twitter.com/PestoEnthusiast}, reads the community's reactions and compiles any new issues found after publishing, because someday we may do an updated compilation!",
						"I've never been part of a team that tests this thoroughly. It is a huge boon that pays off in spades. Our authors love it, and {@i ARCADIA} is better for it. I know I'm grateful.",
						"So when you're watching your players' faces light up as they use one of {@link Scott Fitzgerald Gray's|https://twitter.com/scottfgray} magic weapons, create a custom familiar using {@link Celeste Conowitch's|https://twitter.com/cconowitch} method, or wreak havoc as a goblin in {@link Anthony Joyce's|https://twitter.com/Thrawn589} adventure, join me in giving a hearty thanks to the entire team who makes {@i ARCADIA} awesome.",

Typically, a familiar has one or two of these traits. Odds are the creature you've chosen to convert already has a couple of traits that make sense to keep in its smaller form. Because traits are challenging to design from scratch, look at creature stat blocks similar to the familiar you are creating and borrow traits for your own monstrous creations. Traits tend to vary widely in power, so you must choose traits that low-challenge rating creatures typically have. For example, giving your familiar a {@creature planetar||planetar's} Innate Spellcasting trait would make it too powerful to be a familiar, but giving it something like an {@creature owl||owl's} Flyby trait makes sense.",

Fragments of lore whisper that these mighty weapons, the Arms of Accord, were not crafted by those ancient peoples, but rather were created by benefactors unknown, whose goal was to bind these great lines in accord and allegiance.",
						"At great summits called the Quorum of Sovereigns, hundreds of representatives of the ever-growing humanoid nations would meet to share news and stories, discoveries and portents. An exchange of knowledge was the primary goal throughout this great age of peace, during which the Arms of Accord stood as symbols of leadership and pact\u2014meant to maintain unity among the humanoids against the threats of monsters, magic, and malevolence that could be faced more strongly united than apart.",
						"But as more recent history and the seemingly endless warfare among humanoids show, the dream of unity was not to be.",

The last Quorum of Sovereigns was held over ten millennia ago, and the fragmentary lore of those days suggest that representatives of only two of the humanoid peoples were in attendance, with other nations already falling to strife and warfare.

								"Introducing more potent magic weapons into a campaign than the rules nominally allow is a natural inclination on both sides of the table. Players love getting magic weapons for the benefits their characters gain from them, both in and out of combat. GMs love giving out magic weapons as a means of rewarding fearless action and good play, and for the way powerful weapons and lost magic can connect characters to the history of a campaign.",
								"It's great fun when a 1st-level character claims their first {@item +1 weapon} in the aftermath of a thrilling fight. But too much combat magic at low levels can lead inevitably to even more combat magic through the mid-level range of a campaign. Likewise, the temptation to let lower-level characters claim rare or very rare weapons can be too much to resist sometimes\u2014and suddenly the game's encounter math is thrown out of whack.",
								"The following optional rules (which work with the Arms of Accord or with any magic weapons) create a framework for letting any magic weapon ascend in usability, advancing from a lower state to the height of its power. These rules are just an extension of the general setup of magic item benefits and properties, and are perfect for a GM who wants to tinker with the power creep that comes from too much magic\u2014or who wants to intentionally bring a nominally overpowered weapon into the campaign for narrative purposes without that item potentially disrupting the game.",

										"Scaling back a magic weapon's properties and allowing the weapon to slowly advance as a character rises in level can also fuel all kinds of narrative development. Determining what happened to a weapon to limit its power in the first place might become a mystery the characters investigate alongside the main plot threads of a campaign. The party might need to take on side quests in search of lost lore, rare reagents, or reclusive weaponsmiths to actively restore a weapon's full might. Or, to further emphasize story, consider having the weapon's abilities unlock not just when the wielder reaches a certain level, but specifically in response to a climactic battle, emotional story beat, or act of heroism."

										"For a weapon with multiple distinct properties, the easiest option is to have the most powerful of those properties turned down or turned off. A very rare {@item dwarven thrower} has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls, so dropping that bonus to +1 can effectively make it a rare weapon. Then deciding that its extra damage doesn't function until its wielder has gained more experience can decrease its power even further, making it easy to place a {@item dwarven thrower} into a lower-level campaign and letting its full power build up over time.",
										"This approach also works for adjusting saving throws tied to a magic weapon's attacks or properties. As a general rule, saving throws of common and uncommon magic items should be DC 13, rare items should be DC 15, and very rare or legendary items should be DC 17."

A {@item scimitar of speed} can become appropriate for a low-level character by turning the ability to make an extra attack into a property usable only once per short or long rest. Or the weapon could have charges that fuel a limited number of extra attacks per day, adding narrative flavor by forcing a character to think about how best to use that magic. A weapon that runs out of charges could even risk losing its magic properties, like a staff or wand!",
										"Likewise, a bonus to attack and damage rolls for a magic weapon more powerful than its wielder's level could become a limited bonus usable just once per day. Or to give the bonus more heft\u2014and to prevent a player from feeling unimpressed if it fails to deliver a hit once too often\u2014the bonus can activate and stay in effect until an attack with the weapon hits. For groups that like to experiment with mechanics, this approach also lends itself to playing around with the math behind a bonus to make using a weapon feel more dynamic, swapping a +2 bonus for rolling a {@dice d4} to be added to the attack roll, or trading a +3 for a {@dice d6}."

										"Some magic items might have hidden level considerations that can be easy to overlook. For example, a rare or rarer magic weapon can easily have a property that imposes a long-term effect that can only be dealt with using {@spell dispel magic}, {@spell greater restoration}, {@spell remove curse}, and similar magic, since characters of a level appropriate for such an item should have access to those spells. The {@item rod of rulership} is one example, imposing the {@condition charmed} condition for a long period on an effectively unlimited number of creatures\u2014and potentially tipping the balance of a campaign where characters and NPCs can't shut down that condition with {@spell dispel magic}, {@spell greater restoration}, and similar effects. So when creating a usable-less-often, lower-DC version of such an item, consider also making conditions and effects time-limited, reducing the number of possible targets, or allowing conditions to be ended with a successful Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check."

As an uncommon magic item, the bow might start out only with the ability to deal an extra {@damage 1d6} lightning damage, with that ability recharging after a long rest. As the character levels up, the other two options could come into play, even as the recharge is reduced to once per short rest, then eliminated altogether.",
										"Likewise, instead of casting {@spell control weather}, a 2nd- or 3rd-level character might be able to cast {@spell gust of wind} using the bow, whether with a comic feel or a serious sense of tapping into some small part of a much greater power. That spell might even upgrade to {@spell control winds} at 7th or 8th level before becoming {@spell control weather}. Or the first castings of {@spell control weather} might only recharge after 28 days have passed\u2014letting a character fully tap into the world-shaping power of this ancient relic with little risk of breaking the game."

Gorgenettes are incredibly ornery and not terribly bright, but they make valiant protectors once they decide you're worth saving."

After the initial shock of contending with hundreds of ravenous pocket-sized xorn, the dwarves seized a golden opportunity. Miniature xorn quickly became an ideal familiar for treasure hunters, dungeoneers, or adventurers preparing to explore subterranean tunnels. While the miniature xorn aren't as ferocious as their larger counterparts, their ability to sense treasure, burrow through the earth, and speak Terran makes them invaluable members of any expedition (as long as you keep them fed, of course)."
