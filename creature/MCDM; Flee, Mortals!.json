Why use a higher-level spell when a lower-level one will do? Similarly, the fourth edition design could lead to a kobold minion illogically surviving a fireball spell while a \"stronger\" standard kobold next to them dies, despite both creatures succeeding on their saving throw. By contrast, under this book's minion rules, spellcasters still have a good reason to use high-level spells against minions."

Rather than defending their settlements and breeding grounds against hostile creatures, these poisonous frog folk prefer to establish their homes in places that are nigh-impossible for other humanoids to find, such as underwater caves and other enclosed spaces only accessible by water.
